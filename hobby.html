          <p>
            It is a sport that I love very much.Firstly,I did Antalya in July
            2018.It is an action-packed and <br />
            refreshing sport. This sport realy makes you young.<br />This photo
            is from that time.If You haven't,I highly recommend it.

          <h2>Watching Movie/Series</h2>
          <p>
            I really like watching movies and TV series.Especially I have a
            special interest <br />
            in <strong>Science fiction</strong> movies or TV series. <br />
            The reason for this is actually the effect of technology on people
            in Science Fiction, <br />
            whether good or bad, makes me very excited. <br />
            My favorite movie <strong>Interstellar.</strong>

          <h2>Write Code</h2>
          <p>
            You may be surprised to see coding in my hobbies,but I love opening
            songs <br />
            on the my computer and writing code. When I encounter a problem, it
            gives me great relief <br />
            to deal with it and solve it.That's why i chose this job. If you
            <br />
            think you are interested in these topics,
            <strong>definitely</strong> choose it.

          <h2>Play Baglama</h2>
          <p>
            I love to playing Baglama. I have been playing baglama for about 4
            years.<br />I'm angry at myself for not playing the baglama before,
            Baglama is really very fascinating. <br />
            When one hears that sound, it becomes very peaceful. Maybe all my
            instrument-playing friends feel <br />
            this way, but for me, baglama is something very different.
